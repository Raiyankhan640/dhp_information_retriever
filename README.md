# ‚ùì Document Q&A Assistant

Ask questions about the content of your PDF and Word documents and get instant, structured answers powered by AI. This project uses advanced retrieval and language models to help you extract information from any uploaded documents.

## Features
- Upload any PDF or Word documents
- Ask natural language questions about your document content
- Get instant, structured answers with relevant details
- Modern, user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- Powered by LangChain, Google Gemini, and Hugging Face Embeddings

## How It Works
1. **Upload Documents**: Drag and drop your PDF or Word files.
2. **Process Documents**: The app automatically loads, chunks, and embeds your documents for fast retrieval.
3. **Ask Questions**: Type your question about the document content (e.g., "What topics are covered?" or "Who is mentioned in the file?")
4. **Get Answers**: The AI retrieves relevant information and presents it in a clear, structured format.

## Packages Used
- `streamlit`: For the interactive web UI
- `langchain-community`, `langchain-core`, `langchain-google-genai`, `langchain-huggingface`, `langchain-text-splitters`: For document loading, chunking, embedding, retrieval, and LLM integration
- `faiss-cpu`: For fast vector similarity search
- `python-dotenv`: For environment variable management
- `sentence-transformers`: For generating document embeddings

## Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raiyankhan640/dhp_information_retriever.git
cd dhp_information_retriever
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv myenv
# On Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Gemini API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 5. Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 6. Use the App
- Upload your PDF/Word files
- Click "Process Documents"
- Ask questions in the chat interface
- Get instant, structured answers

## Docker
You can run this app in Docker (recommended for isolation). The repository includes a `Dockerfile` configured to run the Streamlit app.

### Build the image
```bash
docker build -t document-qa-app .
```

### Run the container (local testing)
Pass required environment variables (for example `GEMINI_API_KEY`) using `-e` or a `.env` file.
```bash
# Example: run with an environment variable
docker run -p 8501:8501 -e GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here" document-qa-app

# Or using a .env file
docker run --env-file .env -p 8501:8501 document-qa-app
```

### Tips to reduce image size
- Use the included `.dockerignore` to exclude large files and virtual environments.
- Avoid installing heavy ML packages in the image if not used (for example large `torch` builds pulled in by some embedding packages).
- If the image becomes very large, inspect layers and prune unused images:
```bash
docker image ls
docker image prune -a
```

### Rebuild without cache
If you changed dependencies and want a clean build:
```bash
docker build --no-cache -t document-qa-app .
```

## Notes
- The `myenv` folder (virtual environment) is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
- Only the required packages for this project are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- For best results, use documents with clear, structured information.
