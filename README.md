# ‚ùì Document Q&A Assistant

Ask questions about the content of your PDF and Word documents and get instant, structured answers powered by AI. This project uses advanced retrieval and language models to help you extract information from any uploaded documents.

## Features
- Upload any PDF or Word documents
- Ask natural language questions about your document content
- Get instant, structured answers with relevant details
- Modern, user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- Powered by LangChain, Google Gemini, and Hugging Face Embeddings

## How It Works
1. **Upload Documents**: Drag and drop your PDF or Word files.
2. **Process Documents**: The app automatically loads, chunks, and embeds your documents for fast retrieval.
3. **Ask Questions**: Type your question about the document content (e.g., "What topics are covered?" or "Who is mentioned in the file?")
4. **Get Answers**: The AI retrieves relevant information and presents it in a clear, structured format.

## Packages Used
- `streamlit`: For the interactive web UI
- `langchain-community`, `langchain-core`, `langchain-google-genai`, `langchain-huggingface`, `langchain-text-splitters`: For document loading, chunking, embedding, retrieval, and LLM integration
- `faiss-cpu`: For fast vector similarity search
- `python-dotenv`: For environment variable management
- `sentence-transformers`: For generating document embeddings
